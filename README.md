# Simple-Calculator
Since most people create calculators as their first programming projects, I noticed that most of these programs don't behave like
calculators do. Usually they only take a certain amount of numbers before crashing or simply doing only simple calculations like addition and subtraction.

As I am learning Python, I thought it would be a good idea to a create a console calculator that behaved similar to a real-world calcularo and can do more than
just adding and subtracting.

I do plan on adding some more features here and there but this is primarily to practice my knowledge in Python and programming in general.

Feel free to add any issues if you see any. I love fixing problems : )
